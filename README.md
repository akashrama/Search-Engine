first download project

to also run test code download and import as gradle project

to run the search engine run Main.java and follow instructions

data folder in Main.java may be changed to search over different datasets

sample datasets are provided in the data folder (ie gutenberg, spec-pagerank-ex2, and wikipedia)

TFID and pageRank algorithms have been implemented in their respective files

can be reached by src.main.java.search.analyzers

these files have tests written to ensure functionality

thoses pages use data structures that I've implemented
